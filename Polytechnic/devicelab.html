	<h1> Open Device Lab </h1><br />
	
	<p> A recent introduction to the Polytechnic campus, the Open Device Lab is a place for those looking 
	for help with web development. Students are able to seek guidance in the creation of mobile applications,
	Java script utiliies, webpage design, and other coding related projects.</p>
	
	<p> Originally founded as a grass-roots community movement, the goal of the Open Device Lab is to provide 
	a facility to engage those working with internet-connected devices, and ultimately work towards improving 
	web applications on the whole.</p>
