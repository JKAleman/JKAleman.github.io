		<h1> Our Mission </h1>
		
		<p> Habitat for Humanity believes that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe and 
		affordable place to live. We build and repair houses all over the world using volunteer labor and 
		donations. Our partner families purchase these houses through no-profit, no-interest mortgage loans 
		or innovative financing methods. </p>

		<h1> Why We Build </h1>
		
		<p> There are nearly 2 billion people around the world who live in slum housing and more than 100 
		million are homeless. Families left homeless by natural disasters, war and civil unrest often face 
		dire housing situations as they struggle to rebuild their lives. We provide shelter and housing 
		assistance to help these families recover. </p>
